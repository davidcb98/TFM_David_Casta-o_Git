Code written by David Castaño Bandín to his End Master's Tesis in University of Santiago de Compostela, IGFAE.
End Master's Tesis mentored by Nestor Armesto (IGFAE, University of Santiago de Compostela)

To run the code it's necessary to have instaled the libraries:
    - LHAPDF (at least 6.0.0). See https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/
	You should download the pdf set "PDF4LHC21_40" or change it in the script "main_APFEL".
    - APFEL. See https://apfel.hepforge.org/

About data files:
    In folder "data" there are some pseudo-experimental data (generated with saturation models). 
    As ypu can see, the are four types of files for four difenrent process:
       - LHeC_160: Colission in the (future) acelerator LHeC of 1 TeV protons with 60 MeV electrons
       - LHeC_760: Colission in the (future) acelerator LHeC of 7 TeV protons with 60 MeV electrons
       - FCC_720: Colission in the (future) acelerator FCC of 7 TeV protons with 20 MeV electrons
       - LHeC_5060: Colission in the (future) acelerator LHeC of 50 TeV protons with 60 MeV electrons


Run order:
    - First, run "main_APFEL.py". 
         This program generate some output files that will be saved in folder Output_APFEL.
         It takes the data sets from the folder "data". 
         It compute the DIS reduced cross secctions using APFEL for each giving point (x,Q^2) in the data sets.
         Note: this first part isn't optimize, in sense that this script takes all the files
               sepparately and compute the DIS reduced cross secctions. The optimize way of do this is take all
               the files for the same process (LHeC_160, LHeC_760, FCC_720, FCC_5060) together and
               compute the DIS reduced cross secction only one time per process. (Remmenber that all the files 
               from the same procces have the same values of (x,Q^2))

    - Second, run "main_rew.py". 
         This program generate some output files that will be saved in folder Output_rew.
         It takes the output files from "main_APFEL.py" and do the reweighting.
 
    - Finaly, run "main_post_rew.py". 
         This program generate some output files that will be saved in folder Output_rew_grafs.
         It takes the output files from "main_rew.py" and generate the plots.
